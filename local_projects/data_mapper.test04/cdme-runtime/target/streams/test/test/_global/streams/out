[info] ErrorRouterSpec:
[info] - REQ-F-ERR-001: Right values pass through the router
[info] - REQ-F-ERR-001: Left values are routed as errors
[info] - REQ-F-ERR-001: no record is silently dropped - all processed or errored
[info] - REQ-F-ERR-004: finalize flushes remaining errors to sink
[info] - REQ-F-ERR-004: SinkError is produced when sink fails
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-001: threshold not exceeded for few errors
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-001: absolute error threshold triggers exceeded
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-001: percentage threshold triggers exceeded
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-001: percentage threshold not exceeded at boundary
[info] - currentErrorCount and currentTotalCount track correctly
[info] - flushBuffer writes accumulated errors to sink
[info] - flushBuffer on empty buffer is a no-op
[info] CircuitBreakerSpec:
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-002: low error rate passes circuit breaker
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-002: high error rate trips circuit breaker
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-002: error rate exactly at threshold passes
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-002: error rate just above threshold trips
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-002: zero errors passes circuit breaker
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-002: empty sample passes circuit breaker
[info] - REQ-DATA-QUAL-002: circuit breaker message includes sample error details
[info] - SampleResults: errorRate calculation
[info] - StructuralError contains error rate and threshold
[info] - custom threshold can be more lenient
[info] - custom threshold can be more strict
[info] - CircuitBreakerResult.Passed carries sample metadata
[info] - CircuitBreakerResult.Tripped carries threshold info
[info] RecordAccountingSpec:
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-001: balanced ledger holds invariant
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-001: unbalanced ledger violates invariant
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-001: property - invariant holds iff discrepancy is zero
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-001: zero input count with zero outputs holds invariant
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-002: ledger contains required fields
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-002: factory method creates zeroed ledger
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-003: completion gate verifies balanced ledger
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-003: completion gate rejects unbalanced ledger
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-003: completion gate failure includes discrepancy count
[info] - VerificationStatus enum covers all states
[info] - REQ-F-ACC-002: ledger can include circuit breaker result
[info] - REQ-BR-ERR-001: property - every record must appear in exactly one partition
