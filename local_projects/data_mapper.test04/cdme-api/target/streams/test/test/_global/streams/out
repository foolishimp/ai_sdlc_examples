[info] - REQ-F-LDM-004: entity without grain is rejected
[info] - REQ-F-LDM-005: entity with typed attributes
[info] - REQ-F-API-001: entity ID is derived from name (lowercase, underscored)
[info] - entity builder supports access rules
[info] - CategoryBuilder: build empty category
[info] - CategoryBuilder: add entities and morphisms
[info] - CategoryBuilder: rejects duplicate entity
[info] - CategoryBuilder: validates category on build
[info] MorphismBuilderSpec:
[info] - REQ-F-API-001: build morphism with all required fields
[info] - REQ-F-API-001: morphism builder rejects missing domain
[info] - REQ-F-API-001: morphism builder rejects missing codomain
[info] - REQ-F-LDM-002: morphism builder rejects missing cardinality
[info] - REQ-F-ADJ-001: morphism builder rejects missing forward function
[info] - REQ-F-ADJ-001: morphism builder rejects missing backward function
[info] - OneToOne cardinality maps to Isomorphic containment
[info] - ManyToOne cardinality maps to Preimage containment
[info] - OneToMany cardinality maps to Expansion containment
[info] - built morphism executes forward correctly
[info] - built morphism executes backward correctly
[info] - morphism builder supports access rules
[info] - domain and codomain entity IDs are derived consistently
[info] AcceptanceCriteriaSpec:
[info] - AC-CDME-001: LDM is represented as a category with identity and associativity laws
[info] - AC-CDME-002: path validation catches missing morphisms at definition time
[info] - AC-CDME-002: path validation catches missing entity at definition time
[info] - AC-CDME-003: grain safety violations are rejected at definition time
[info] - AC-CDME-003: coarser-to-finer aggregation is rejected
[info] - AC-CDME-004: identical inputs + config produce identical outputs
[info] - AC-CDME-004: category version hash is deterministic
[info] - AC-CDME-005: zero implicit type conversions -- all conversions must be named morphisms
[info] - AC-CDME-006: all failures routed via Either monad; no silent record drops
[info] - AC-CDME-007: every morphism implements Adjoint interface with containment laws
[info] - AC-CDME-008: |input| = |processed| + |filtered| + |errored| for every run
[info] - AC-CDME-009: every target value traces to source epoch, entity, and morphism path
[info] - AC-CDME-009: adjoint backward result carries traceability metadata
[info] - AC-CDME-010: AI-generated mappings pass identical validation as human mappings
[info] - AC-CDME-011: zero silent data loss across all runs
[info] - AC-CDME-011: filter adjoint captures filtered records, not silently dropping them
