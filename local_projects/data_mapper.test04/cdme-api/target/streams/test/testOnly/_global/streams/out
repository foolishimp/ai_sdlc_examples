[debug] Running TaskDef(cdme.acceptance.AcceptanceCriteriaSpec, org.scalatest.tools.Framework$$anon$1@1eab19eb, false, [SuiteSelector])
[info] AcceptanceCriteriaSpec:
[info] - AC-CDME-001: LDM is represented as a category with identity and associativity laws
[info] - AC-CDME-002: path validation catches missing morphisms at definition time
[info] - AC-CDME-002: path validation catches missing entity at definition time
[info] - AC-CDME-003: grain safety violations are rejected at definition time
[info] - AC-CDME-003: coarser-to-finer aggregation is rejected
[info] - AC-CDME-004: identical inputs + config produce identical outputs
[info] - AC-CDME-004: category version hash is deterministic
[info] - AC-CDME-005: zero implicit type conversions -- all conversions must be named morphisms
[info] - AC-CDME-006: all failures routed via Either monad; no silent record drops
[info] - AC-CDME-007: every morphism implements Adjoint interface with containment laws
[info] - AC-CDME-008: |input| = |processed| + |filtered| + |errored| for every run *** FAILED ***
[info]   Gave up after 8 successful property evaluations. 51 evaluations were discarded.
[info]   Init Seed: -9048575174974888418
[info] - AC-CDME-009: every target value traces to source epoch, entity, and morphism path
[info] - AC-CDME-009: adjoint backward result carries traceability metadata
[info] - AC-CDME-010: AI-generated mappings pass identical validation as human mappings
[info] - AC-CDME-011: zero silent data loss across all runs
[info] - AC-CDME-011: filter adjoint captures filtered records, not silently dropping them
