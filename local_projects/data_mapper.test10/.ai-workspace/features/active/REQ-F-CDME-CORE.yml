description: |
  Build the core categorical data mapping engine: schemas as categories,
  transformations as functors, with mathematical guarantees for pipeline
  correctness, lineage preservation, grain safety, and type enforcement.
  Targets Scala 2.13 + Apache Spark 3.5.

requirements:
  - REQ-F-CDME-001   # Schema as Category (Objects + Morphisms)
  - REQ-F-CDME-002   # LDM / PDM Separation
  - REQ-F-CDME-003   # Transformations as Functors
  - REQ-F-CDME-004   # Grain Safety (dimension checking)
  - REQ-F-CDME-005   # Type Contracts (semantic types)
  - REQ-NFR-CDME-001 # Pipeline Correctness at Definition Time
  - REQ-NFR-CDME-002 # Full Lineage Traceability
  - REQ-DATA-CDME-001 # Schema Validation Rules
  - REQ-BR-CDME-001  # Topology as Guardrail (reject invalid mappings)
