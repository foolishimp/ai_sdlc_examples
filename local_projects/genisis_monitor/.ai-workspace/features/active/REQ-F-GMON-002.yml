  Foundational vector: extend models and parsers to support v2.5 data structures.
  All other v2.5 feature vectors depend on these models existing.

requirements:
  - REQ-F-EVSCHEMA-001  # Typed event parsing (9 event types)
  - REQ-F-EVSCHEMA-002  # Cross-event linkage
  - REQ-F-REGIME-001    # Evaluator regime classification
  - REQ-F-VREL-001      # Spawn relationship tracking (FeatureVector model)
  - REQ-F-TBOX-001      # Time-box parsing (FeatureVector model)
  - REQ-F-PROF-001      # Profile parsing (GraphTopology model)
  - REQ-F-CDIM-001      # Constraint dimension parsing (GraphTopology model)
