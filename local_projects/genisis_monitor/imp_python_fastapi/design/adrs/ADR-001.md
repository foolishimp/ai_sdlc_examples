# ADR-001: In-Memory State Only — No Database

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-02-21
**Feature**: REQ-F-GMON-001
**Drives**: REQ-NFR-002

---

## Context

The genesis monitor needs to maintain state about discovered projects and their parsed methodology data. Options include SQLite, Redis, flat-file cache, or pure in-memory state.

## Decision

All state is held in-memory as Python dataclass objects. State is rebuilt from the filesystem on startup by scanning and parsing `.ai-workspace/` directories. Incremental updates are driven by watchdog filesystem events.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **SQLite**: Provides persistence across restarts but adds complexity (schema migrations, query layer) for data that is always derivable from the filesystem.
2. **Redis**: Inappropriate for a single-process tool; adds external dependency.
3. **Flat-file cache**: Marginal benefit over re-parsing; adds cache invalidation complexity.

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- Zero external dependencies; `pip install -e .` and run
- No cache invalidation bugs; always consistent with filesystem
- Simple mental model: data flows filesystem → parsers → models → views

**Negative**:
- Startup cost scales with number of projects (mitigated by REQ-NFR-003: <5s for 50 projects)
- No persistence across restarts (acceptable — data is always on filesystem)
