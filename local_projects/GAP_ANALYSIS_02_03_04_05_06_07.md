# Gap Analysis: test02 vs test03 vs test04 vs test05 vs test06 vs test07

**Date**: 2026-02-23
**Purpose**: Cross-comparison of six CDME dogfood runs to track methodology evolution and identify remaining gaps.

---

## 1. Context

| | test02 | test03 | test04 | test05 | test06 | test07 |
|-|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Methodology** | v1.x (7-stage pipeline) | v2.1 (Asset Graph, no gap detection) | v2.1+ (three-direction gap detection, event sourcing) | v2.3 (constraint dimensions, 3 design variants, parallel gen) | v2.8 (IntentEngine, tolerances, functor encoding, full-auto profile) | **v2.8 (design-first, human-reviewed design, pre-seeded arch guidance)** |
| **Intent source** | mapper_requirements.md v7.2 (human-authored) | Simplified from test02 | Full test02 intent (6 INT sections) | Full test02 intent (6 INT sections) | Full test02 intent (6 INT sections) | **Full test02 intent (6 INT sections) + test04 arch guidance in CLAUDE.md** |
| **Edges traversed** | intent→req→design(x3)→code→tests | intent→req→design→code | intent→req→design→code→unit_tests→uat_tests | intent→req→design(x3)→code (scala_spark only) | intent→req→design→code→unit_tests→uat_tests (all 5 edges, full profile) | **req→design (human review) → code+unit_tests (parallel with design)** |
| **Design variants** | 3 (Spark, dbt, generic) | 1 | 1 | 3 (scala_spark, pyspark, dbt) | 1 (scala_spark — deliberate single-design) | **1 (scala_spark — imp_scala_spark/ tenant)** |
| **Build approach** | Multiple iterations over weeks | Single-pass per edge | Single-pass per edge | Single-pass, parallel design (3 agents), parallel code gen (4 agents) | Single-shot `/gen-start --auto`, sequential edges, full-auto profile | **Design-first: explicit design phase with human review gate, then code gen from reviewed design** |
| **Build status** | Spark 2.12, compiles, 252 tests pass | Never compiled | All 8 modules compile, 252 tests pass | All 8 modules compile (Scala 2.13.12), 0 tests | All 8 modules compile (Scala 2.13.12), 95 tests pass | **Not yet compiled (no sbt env); 76 Scala files, 6,108 LOC generated** |
| **Key innovation** | First complete run | Graph formalism | Gap detection + TDD co-evolution | Multi-design from same reqs + parallel code gen | Uninterrupted single-shot build; full-auto profile; v2.8 per-edge event emission | **First run with `imp_<design>/` tenant structure (GAP-043/044 FIXED); design-first with human review; pre-seeded arch from test04; installer scaffolds graph_topology.yml (GAP-042 FIXED)** |

### From test05 Gaps (GAP-021 through GAP-034)

## 4. New Gaps Discovered in test06 (with test07 status)

| ID | Gap | Source | Severity | test07 | Status |
|----|-----|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| GAP-035 | **No Mermaid diagrams in design doc** | test04 had 7, test05 had 13, test06 has 0 | Low | **5 Mermaid diagrams in DESIGN.md** | **FIXED** |
| GAP-036 | **Source code is compact but shallow** | 1,578 lines across 30 files (53 LOC/file avg) | Medium | **3,620 lines across 47 files (77 LOC/file avg)** | **IMPROVED** — 2.3x test06, approaching test04 depth |
| GAP-037 | **16 specification REQ keys not found in code** | 59/75 unique REQ keys traced (79%) | Medium | **70/75 unique REQ keys (93%)** | **IMPROVED** — only 5 untraced (likely NFR/regulatory) |
| GAP-038 | **`evaluator_overrides` in project_constraints.yml is unimplemented** | Template suggests override mechanism | Low | **Not addressed** | **OPEN** |
| GAP-039 | **Custom profile discovery undocumented** | `full-auto` profile works but undocumented | Low | **Not addressed** | **OPEN** |
| GAP-040 | **95 tests vs test04's 252** | Fewer tests despite TDD + BDD edges | Medium | **29 test files, 2,488 LOC** (most test files of any run) | **IMPROVED** — highest test file count; need sbt to count test cases |
| GAP-041 | **REQ key format inconsistency** | Mixed `REQ-F-LDM-001` and `REQ-LDM-01` | Low | **Uses spec-domain format (REQ-LDM-01 etc.) consistently** | **IMPROVED** — consistent within test07, but differs from spec format |
| GAP-042 | **Installer doesn't scaffold `graph_topology.yml`** | gen-setup.py missing graph/ | **High** | **FIXED — gen-setup.py now copies graph_topology.yml** | **FIXED** |
| GAP-043 | **Code at project root instead of `imp_<design>/`** | 8 sbt modules at `./` instead of `./imp_scala_spark/` | **High** | **FIXED — all code under imp_scala_spark/code/** | **FIXED** |
| GAP-044 | **No constraint enforcing multi-tenant folder structure** | No signal that root-level code is wrong | **High** | **FIXED — CLAUDE.md has CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: "All design documents, ADRs, code, and tests MUST go under imp_scala_spark/"** | **FIXED** |

---

## 4b. New Gaps Discovered in test07

| ID | Gap | Source | Severity | Recommendation |
|----|-----|--------|----------|----------------|
| GAP-045 | **No sbt compilation validation** | test07 generated 76 Scala files but has no sbt environment to compile them. Previous runs (test04, test05, test06) all verified compilation. | **High** | Provide sbt environment and run `sbt compile && sbt test`. Until then, type-level correctness is unverified. |
| GAP-046 | **Manual build bypassed methodology commands** | Design and code generated by direct agent invocation, not through `/gen-start` or `/gen-iterate`. No edge events emitted, no feature vector created, no convergence tracking. | **High** | Future runs should use methodology commands to ensure full event emission and feature vector tracking. The design-first pattern is valid but needs to be encoded as a methodology profile. |
| GAP-047 | **No BDD/UAT scenarios** | test04 had 215 Gherkin scenarios, test06 had 14 AcceptanceCriteria tests. test07 has unit tests only. | Medium | Traverse the `design→uat_tests` edge separately, generating Gherkin feature files in `imp_scala_spark/tests/`. |
| GAP-048 | **Design phase not event-logged** | The requirements→design edge produced DESIGN.md + 13 ADRs but emitted no `edge_started`/`edge_converged` events. | Medium | If running design-first manually, emit events via `gen-iterate` or a dedicated design-review command. |
| GAP-049 | **REQ key format uses short form** | Code uses `REQ-LDM-01` format (from mapper_requirements.md) rather than `REQ-F-LDM-001` format (from REQUIREMENTS.md). Both valid but inconsistent across runs. | Low | Settle on one canonical format and add a normalizer/validator. |
| GAP-050 | **10 source findings in DESIGN.md not dispositioned** | Design phase found 10 spec ambiguities (§13 Source Findings) but no feedback loop to spec or disposition log. | Medium | Add a design→spec feedback mechanism for source findings that require spec clarification. |

## 5. Evolution Across Runs

### What Got Better (test02 → test03 → test04 → test05 → test06)

| Dimension | test02→03 | test03→04 | test04→05 | test05→06 | test06→07 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Methodology formalism** | Implicit → explicit graph | + gap detection | v2.3: constraint dims, Markov | v2.8: IntentEngine, tolerances | **Design-first with human review gate** |
| **Build automation** | Manual iterations | Single-pass | Parallel gen | Full single-shot, zero human gates | **Design-first: explicit review, then code gen** |
| **Observability** | None | 5 events | 1 event (regressed) | 13 events (best yet) | **1 event (regressed — manual build)** |
| **Feature tracking** | None | Converged | Partial (1 edge) | All 5 edges converged | **Not created (regressed — manual build)** |
| **Test coverage** | 252 tests | 252 tests | 0 tests (regressed) | 95 tests (recovered) | **29 test files, 2,488 LOC (highest file count)** |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Present | Missing | Missing | Present (pre-seeded) | **Best yet (432 lines, bootloader + arch guidance)** |
| **Constraint binding** | None | None | 8 dims defined | 8 dims + fully bound | **8 dims + bound (stable)** |
| **Build errors** | N/A | 0 | ~100 (parallel) | 0 (sequential) | **Pending sbt validation** |
| **Profile system** | N/A | N/A | N/A | Custom full-auto profile | **N/A (manual build)** |
| **Folder structure** | N/A | N/A | N/A | Violated (GAP-043) | **FIXED — imp_scala_spark/ tenant** |
| **Design depth** | ~800 lines | ~1,200 lines | 4,194 lines | 850 lines | **1,966 lines + 13 ADRs (~1,800 lines)** |
| **REQ traceability** | N/A | N/A | 64/69 (93%) | 59/75 (79%) | **70/75 (93%) — best per-key** |
| **Arch pre-seeding** | None | None | None | None | **test04 module structure in CLAUDE.md** |

### What Stayed the Same or Regressed

| Dimension | test06 Status | Root Cause | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Mermaid diagrams** | **Regressed** (13→0) | Not in single-shot agent priority | Add to evaluator checklist |
| **Source code volume** | **Lower** (1,578 vs 8,000 lines) | Single-shot generates skeleton, not production depth | May need iterate cycles for depth |
| **Test count** | **Lower** (95 vs 252) | Single-shot TDD produces fewer tests | Iterate on TDD edge for more coverage |
| **ADR carry-forward** | Still no protocol | No mechanism in methodology | Add `adr_carry_forward` evaluator |
| **STATUS.md** | Still missing | Not in gen-start | Add to init scaffold |
| **Skip policy** | Still missing | No framework | Add to evaluator config |
| **Evaluator rigour** | Not stress-tested | Sequential avoided parallel bugs | Need both modes validated |
| **Folder structure** | **VIOLATED** — code at root, not `imp_<design>/` | No constraint enforces the standard | Add `structure.design_tenants` to project_constraints + edge checklist |
| **Monitor integration** | **BROKEN** — blank dashboard | Installer doesn't scaffold `graph_topology.yml` | Add to `gen-setup.py` workspace scaffolding |

## 6. ADR Analysis: test06 vs Prior Runs

### ADR Count Progression

| Run | Total ADRs | Topics | Maturity |
|-----|-----------|--------|----------|
| test02 | **31** | 11 generic + 13 Spark + 5 dbt + 2 late | Discovery — exploring the decision space |
| test03 | **6** | 6 (single design) | Distilled — core categorical decisions only |
| test04 | **13** | 13 (single design, comprehensive) | Production — comprehensive, feature-mapped |
| test05 | **15** | 5 x 3 designs (template pattern) | Pragmatic — breadth over depth |
| test06 | **7** | 7 (single design, improved topic selection) | **Focused — better topic coverage than test05** |

### test06's 7 ADRs vs test04's 13

| test06 ADR | Topic | test04 Equivalent | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| ADR-001 | Category Theory as Foundation | ADR-003 (layered arch) | **NEW framing** — category theory explicit |
| ADR-002 | Compile-then-Execute Pattern | Implicit in test04 | **NEW** — compiler pattern now an explicit decision |
| ADR-003 | Errors as Data (Either Monad) | ADR-004 (Either monad) | **MATCHED** |
| ADR-004 | Adjoint Pairs for All Morphisms | ADR-005 (Adjoint-as-trait) | **MATCHED** |
| ADR-005 | Immutable Run Hierarchy | ADR-006 (Content-addressed versioning) | **PARTIALLY MATCHED** — different angle |
| ADR-006 | Spark as Default Runtime | ADR-009 (Spark binding) | **MATCHED** |
| ADR-007 | sbt Multi-Module DAG | Implicit in test04 | **NEW** — build structure now explicit |

### Still Missing from test04's Set

| test04 ADR | Topic | Severity | test06 Status |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------------|
| ADR-002 | Sealed ADT for type system | High | Code has sealed traits but no ADR |
| ADR-007 | Writer monad for telemetry | High | **MISSING** |
| ADR-008 | Monoid typeclass for aggregation | High | Code has Monoid but no ADR |
| ADR-010 | Programmatic API over config | Medium | **MISSING** |
| ADR-011 | Reverse-join table strategy | High | Code has reverse-join but no ADR |
| ADR-012 | Circuit breaker with sampling | High | **MISSING** |

**Improvement over test05**: test06 has 7 ADRs with meaningful topic diversity (category theory, compiler pattern, errors, adjoints, versioning, Spark, build) vs test05's 5-slot template repeated 3x. However, 3 high-severity test04 ADRs remain undocumented (Writer monad, reverse-join strategy, circuit breaker).

---

## 7. Structural Violations: Folder Layout and Monitor Integration

### 7.1 Multi-Tenant Folder Structure Violated (GAP-043, GAP-044)

The methodology's standard is `specification/` (shared, tech-agnostic) + `imp_<design>/` (self-contained, independently buildable). This is the same pattern used in the methodology repository itself:

```
ai_sdlc_method/
├── specification/        # shared WHAT
├── imp_claude/           # Claude Code: design + code + tests
├── imp_gemini/           # Gemini: design + code + tests
└── imp_codex/            # Codex: design + code + tests
```

test06 should have produced:
```
data_mapper.test06/
├── specification/                    # shared spec (correct)
│   ├── INTENT.md
│   ├── REQUIREMENTS.md
│   └── mapper_requirements.md
├── imp_scala_spark/                  # self-contained design tenant
│   ├── design/
│   │   ├── DESIGN.md
│   │   └── adrs/
│   ├── build.sbt
│   ├── project/
│   ├── cdme-model/
│   ├── cdme-compiler/
│   ├── cdme-runtime/
│   ├── cdme-spark/
│   ├── cdme-lineage/
│   ├── cdme-adjoint/
│   ├── cdme-ai-assurance/
│   └── cdme-api/
├── .ai-workspace/
└── CLAUDE.md
```

Instead test06 produced everything at root — 8 sbt module directories, `build.sbt`, and `specification/DESIGN.md` all at the same level. This means:

- **Cannot add `imp_pyspark/`** without first moving all scala_spark files
- **Cannot run independent parallel builds** — the root is polluted
- **Design doc in wrong location** — `specification/DESIGN.md` conflates spec (WHAT) with design (HOW)
- **No isolation** — a future `imp_dbt/` would share the root `.scalafmt.conf`, `.gitignore`, etc.

### Root Cause Chain

```
1. project_constraints.yml has no `structure.design_tenants` constraint
2. CLAUDE.md mentions "8 sbt modules" but not WHERE they go
3. design→code edge checklist has no output directory rule
4. The agent defaults to root (simplest path)
5. No post-gen evaluator checks for "files outside specification/ and imp_*/"
```

### 7.2 Monitor Integration Broken at Installer Level (GAP-042)

`gen-setup.py` creates:
```
.ai-workspace/
├── events/events.jsonl       ✓
├── features/active/          ✓
├── context/project_constraints.yml  ✓
├── tasks/                    ✓
├── agents/                   ✓
└── spec/                     ✓
```

Genesis Monitor expects:
```

Without `graph_topology.yml`, the monitor shows: no asset graph, no edge convergence, no feature vectors, no constraint dimensions — effectively a blank dashboard despite 13 events and a fully converged feature vector.

**Fix**: `gen-setup.py` should copy `graph_topology.yml` from the plugin's `config/` directory into `.ai-workspace/graph/` during workspace scaffolding. This is the same file that defines the methodology's asset types, transitions, and constraint dimensions — it's the integration contract between the methodology plugin and the observability layer.

## 8. The Single-Shot Paradigm: What test06 Proves (continued)

### 7.1 Uninterrupted Build Works

test06 is the first run where `/gen-start --auto` traversed all edges without pausing for human review. The `full-auto` custom profile eliminated all human evaluator gates while preserving full edge traversal. This validates that:

- The projection profile system works for customizing evaluator composition
- Agent + deterministic evaluators are sufficient for a complete build
- Per-edge event emission (v2.8) works — 13 events logged, one per edge transition

### 7.2 Pre-Seeding Spec Reduces Ambiguity

By copying test02's proven spec docs into test06's `specification/` directory, the build started with high-quality input material. Result:
- Only 2 source findings (vs test04's 56 and test05's 15)
- Zero compilation errors (vs test05's ~100)
- 97% file-level REQ traceability

### 7.3 Sequential + Single-Design Avoids Parallel Failure Mode

test06 deliberately chose single-design to avoid GAP-021 (parallel type mismatches). This worked — zero compilation errors, clean builds throughout. But it means GAP-021 remains **unfixed** in the methodology; it's just **avoided** by not using parallel generation.

### 7.4 Compact Code: Feature or Bug?

test06 produced 1,578 source lines vs test04's 8,000. This could mean:
- **Feature**: Single-shot is more focused, avoids over-engineering
- **Bug**: Skeleton implementations that lack production depth

The 95 passing tests suggest the code is functional, but the lower line count warrants investigation. The 1:1 test-to-code line ratio is actually healthy.

## 9. Priority Recommendations

### Critical (blocks production use)

1. **GAP-043: Code at root instead of `imp_<design>/`** — All 8 sbt modules and `build.sbt` generated at project root. This violates the multi-tenant standard (`specification/` + `imp_<name>/`) and makes it impossible to add a second design variant without restructuring. The agent had no constraint telling it where to place code.
2. **GAP-044: No constraint enforcing multi-tenant folder structure** — The root cause of GAP-043. Nothing in `project_constraints.yml`, `CLAUDE.md`, or the `design→code` edge checklist specifies the `imp_<name>/` convention. Without this constraint, every run will default to root-level code.
3. **GAP-042: Installer doesn't scaffold `graph_topology.yml`** — Genesis Monitor can't see the project at all. The integration contract between methodology and monitor is broken at the installer level.
4. **GAP-021: Parallel generation type contract** — Still unfixed. test06 avoids it with single-design. Next test should try parallel gen with the v2.8 methodology to see if better event emission + iterate agent helps.

### High (reduces value significantly)

5. **GAP-011: Evaluator rigour** — Sequential build means test06 didn't stress-test evaluator convergence. Need a run that deliberately introduces errors to validate evaluators catch them.
6. **GAP-031/032: ADR carry-forward + minimum topics** — test06 improved from 5 to 7 ADRs with better topic diversity, but still missing 3 high-severity architectural decisions from test04. Formal carry-forward protocol needed.
7. **GAP-037: 16 REQ keys not in code** — 59/75 spec REQs traced to code (79%). The 16 missing keys need disposition (implemented but untagged, deferred, or N/A for NFR/regulatory).
8. **GAP-036: Code depth vs skeleton** — 1,578 lines is lean for 8 modules with 75 requirements. Compare functional completeness per module vs test04.
9. **GAP-040: Test depth** — 95 tests vs test04's 252. Sufficient for validation but may miss edge cases. Iterate TDD edge for more coverage.

### Medium (nice-to-have for methodology completeness)

7. **GAP-035: Mermaid diagrams** — Regressed from 13→0. Add to evaluator checklist.
8. **GAP-038: evaluator_overrides placeholder** — Template suggests feature that doesn't exist. Implement or remove.
9. **GAP-039: Profile discovery undocumented** — The full-auto profile mechanism works but isn't documented.
10. **GAP-041: REQ key format inconsistency** — Mixed formats in code. Add format validator.
11. **GAP-025: STATUS.md** — Still missing after 4 runs. Add to init scaffold.
12. **GAP-007: Checkpoint mechanism** — 5 runs, never used.
13. **GAP-012: Skip policy** — Lint/format checks still not run.

## 10. Run Comparison Summary

| | test02 | test03 | test04 | test05 | test06 | test07 |
|-|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Strongest at** | Test coverage, ADR count, REQ density | Graph formalism | Observability, gap detection, TDD | Multi-design, parallel gen, design depth, technology honesty | Build automation, observability, feature tracking, constraint binding | **Design depth, ADR depth, REQ traceability, folder structure, arch pre-seeding, design-first review** |
| **Weakest at** | No formalism, no observability | No tests, no build | Design variants (only 1) | No tests, poor observability, ADR depth regression | Code depth, Mermaid diagrams, ADR carry-forward | **No sbt validation, no methodology event emission, no feature vector, no BDD** |
| **Unique contribution** | Proved full pipeline works | Proved v2.1 formalism | Proved gap detection + TDD co-evolution | Proved multi-design + parallel gen + honest tech limitations | Proved single-shot uninterrupted build; custom profiles; v2.8 event emission | **Proved design-first with human review; first correct imp_<design>/ structure (GAP-043/044 FIXED); arch pre-seeding from prior runs; installer graph_topology.yml (GAP-042 FIXED)** |
| **Methodology lesson** | A complete pipeline beats a partial one | Formalism alone isn't enough | Observability + testing close the loop | Parallelism needs reconciliation; ADRs need carry-forward | Pre-seeded spec + custom profile + sequential edges = cleanest build | **Design-first with human review + arch pre-seeding from best prior run = deepest design + best traceability; but must use methodology commands to get observability** |

## 11. What test07 Achieved and What Remains

### test07's Unique Contributions

1. **First correct `imp_<design>/` tenant structure** (GAP-043/044 FIXED) — All design, code, and tests under `imp_scala_spark/` with proper `design/`, `code/`, `tests/` subdirectories. This is the first run that matches the methodology repository's own structure.

2. **Design-first with human review** — Explicit design phase (DESIGN.md + 13 ADRs) produced and reviewed before code generation. This is the methodology's intended flow: design is an evaluator gate, not a byproduct.

3. **Architecture pre-seeding from prior runs** — CLAUDE.md pre-loaded with test04's proven 8-module structure, dependency rules, and domain concepts. The design agent had rich context, producing deeper and more consistent output.

4. **Best REQ traceability** — 70/75 unique REQ keys traced in code (93%), 44 unique keys in tests. 100% of source files tagged with `Implements:`. This is the highest per-key traceability of any run.

5. **Best design depth** — 1,966-line DESIGN.md + 13 ADRs averaging ~130 lines each (~3,700 lines total design documentation). 5 Mermaid diagrams, full traceability matrix, 10 source findings.

6. **Installer now scaffolds `graph_topology.yml`** (GAP-042 FIXED) — Genesis Monitor integration works out of the box.

### What test07 Lost (vs test06)

| Dimension | test06 | test07 | Root Cause |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Event emission | 13 events | 1 event | Manual build bypassed methodology commands |
| Feature vector | All 5 edges converged | Not created | No `/gen-start` or `/gen-iterate` invoked |
| Build validation | 352 .class files, 95 tests pass | Pending | No sbt environment |
| BDD scenarios | 14 AcceptanceCriteria | 0 | BDD edge not traversed |
| Build automation | Full single-shot | Manual agent invocation | Design-first pattern not yet encoded as profile |

### Composite Best-of-All-Runs (Hypothetical test08)

| Dimension | Best Run | Value |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Methodology | test06/07 | v2.8 (IntentEngine, tolerances, functors) |
| Build automation | test06 | `/gen-start --auto` with full-auto profile |
| Observability | test06 | 13 events, all edges tracked |
| Test coverage | test04 | 252 tests, TDD + BDD |
| Code depth | test04 | 8,000 lines, 71 files |
| ADR depth | **test07** | 13 ADRs, comprehensive, cross-referenced |
| Design depth | **test07** | 1,966 lines + 5 Mermaid diagrams |
| Folder structure | **test07** | `imp_<design>/` tenant pattern |
| Multi-design | test05 | 3 variants, technology honesty |
| Traceability | **test07** | 93% per-key, 100% per-file |
| Pre-seeded spec | test06/07 | Reduces ambiguity, clean builds |
| Arch pre-seeding | **test07** | test04 module structure in CLAUDE.md |
| Feature tracking | test04/06 | All edges converged |
| Design-first review | **test07** | Human review gate on design |

**test08 recipe**: test07's design-first pattern + test06's `/gen-start --auto` execution + `imp_<design>/` constraint baked into methodology commands + `graph_topology.yml` in installer + iterate on TDD + BDD edges for depth + sbt validation step.
